This is a security Bypass I coded at my school in probably 2 hours, Securly has a problem where about:blank websites will not show up when looking at students' screens or tabs list. I am not sure if this works with any other school screen viewers but it is a work in progress. 



This code has a file named launcher.html which is what you will have bookmarked on your Chromebook. you will open the launcher and enter the password (the password can be changed via the file and is just exposed so try and hide the file). after you log in you will click the Launch Button and then the main script with the About Blank opener will open in About Blank as well so they will not know that file location as well IT IS VERY BUGGY so don't expect it to always work
